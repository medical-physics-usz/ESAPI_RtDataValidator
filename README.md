# ESAPI Script to evaluate plan parameters

This script was developed over several years at the Radiation Oncology Department of the University Hospital Zurich to verify plan parameters of VMAT plans. 

In the anonymized example below you can see the script in action with several entries:
1) Green entries: values within parameters
2) Violet entries: values that require a manual review
3) Red entries: values outside the accepted range
